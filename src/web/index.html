        <h1>Welcome to Bokeda</h1>
        <h2>Automatic Bookkeeping Program</h2>
        <p>Bokeda is designed to be a secure and locally hosted personal bookkeeper.
            Upload your bank statements at the end of the financial
            year, and it will automatically categorise your transactions before creating a dashboard for you to summarise
            and analyse your finances. At first, Bokeda will not know how to categorise your transactions, so you will
            be training it by selecting the category that you believe is most relevant to the transaction. Eventually, Bokeda
            will learn patterns in the transactions so that everything is automated (other than data it's never seen before).</p>
        <h4>Bokeda is completely locally hosted so no information will be transmitted through the internet unless your local machine is compromised.</h4>
